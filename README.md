TStelnet
========

TStelnet is a simple Teamspeak 3 - telnet client for doing some operations normally hidden like moving two or more people at the same time.


Unfortunately we do not have the time any more for further development. We stopped at debugging the second tab.
First tab, the improved telnet console, is completely working and we're proud it's a better console for teamspeak than any telnet client ;)

So far, feel free to request pulls, we will of course take care of them.

And if you're going to find some login credentials in the code: feel free to test them. They won't work. Use your own ;)


###Requirements
- A Teamspeak 3 Server with ServerQuery (telnet) running on it.
- Further an account with admin privileges on it.
- And ServerQuery login credentials. Can be generated from the Teamspeak user interface.

For any questions do not hesitate to contact us.
